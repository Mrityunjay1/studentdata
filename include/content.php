			<h2>Welcome to EIT Management College</h2>
			

            <p>EIT Management College offers both Open and Customized programmes. The Open Programmes are either Short Duration Programmes(SDPs) or Long Duration Programmes(LDPs).

The SDPs are of 3-5 days duration and address some of the issues facing the industry practitioners and/or based on the research interests of our faculty.

The LDPs are part-time programmes offered over 2-12 months. They address the needs of Managers for General Management skills or impact specialized skills/knowledge in a niche area such as Business Analytics, Entrepreneurship or Finance.

The participants' diversity in open programmes contributes significaross-learning and provides continuing networking opportunities beyond the classroom. These programmes are held at cipation will be awarded by IIMB to participants on successful completion of the programme(s).

Located amidst hills and farmlands, the temporary campus of EITM is peaceful and far away from the hubbub of the metropolis. Along with this peace, our lives revolve around classes, assignments, presentations and exams. Meeting the not-so-realistic deadlines for these components of evaluation is what majorly makes up for most of the time of a day here. Students at IIM Sambalpur run a number of student committees and clubs. On one hand, we have academic committee, commonly known as Acadcom, which acts as a liaison between the faculty and the students. This committee puts forward the issues pertaining to academic curriculum and studentsâ€™ incessant requests for deadline extensions.

If we have the Acadcom at one end of the spectrum we also have the Cultural and the Sports Committee to lighten the ambience and foster much needed interaction between the batch mates.

Life here is hectic but it is never mundane. Unexpected is always expected here which means we need to be on our toes all the time. But of course, we still manage to have our share of fun.
